# DinoRuning-ml-game-training
A simple game similar to Google's dinosaur, programmed in Python, the plan for this project is to train a machine learning model that has to learn to play, with a genetic model<br>

<p1>|```/main.py```: Is the main file, it makes the learning process, using auxilliar .</p1><br>
<p1>|```/genetic_model.py```: Is the main file, it makes the learning process.</p1><br>
<p1>|```/Game```->```/Game.py```:Game is the game itself, ```Game.play(models)``` takes a lists of models to predict jumps in game and returns pairs of each model and the score that it got .</p1><br><br>

<p1>|-> ```/assets/```: Contains the gameÂ´s sprites.</p1><br>
